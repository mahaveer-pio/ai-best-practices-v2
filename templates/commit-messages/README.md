title: Traceability – How the pieces connect
audience: Humans (developers, reviewers, auditors)
purpose: Show the end-to-end linkage between usage docs, commits, hooks, and CI
---

- **Commit Message Templates** (`COMMIT-MESSAGE-TEMPLATES.md`) define how to tag AI work with `[AI-ASSISTED]` and attribution fields.
- **Local Git Hooks** (`hooks/`):
  - `commit-msg` enforces the presence of `Generated by:` and `Reviewed by:` when `[AI-ASSISTED-...]` is used.
  - Pre-commit hooks under [`tools/scripts/`](../../tools/scripts/) can be installed into `.git/hooks/` to detect AI code and update `AI-USAGE.md`.
- **AI-USAGE.md** (in `docs/governance/`) is the human-readable log that these hooks update.
- **GitHub Actions** (future: `tools/workflows/ai-code-compliance.yml`) will re-check on PRs that any `[AI-...]` commits are also documented in `AI-USAGE.md`.

Together, these create a complete audit trail from **code changes → commit messages → usage log → CI verification**.
