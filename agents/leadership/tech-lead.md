# ADR-001: Database Technology Selection for User Management Service

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our user management service currently uses a file-based storage system that doesn't meet our scalability and consistency requirements. We need to select a database technology that can:
- Handle 10,000+ concurrent users
- Provide ACID transactions for user data
- Support horizontal scaling for future growth
- Integrate well with our existing Node.js stack
- Minimize operational complexity

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database for the user management service.

## Rationale
**Considered Options:**
1. **PostgreSQL** (Selected)
   - ‚úÖ Excellent ACID compliance and consistency
   - ‚úÖ Strong ecosystem and Node.js integration
   - ‚úÖ Horizontal scaling with read replicas
   - ‚úÖ Team familiarity and operational experience
   - ‚úÖ Rich feature set (JSON, full-text search, extensions)

2. **MongoDB**
   - ‚úÖ Flexible schema and easy horizontal scaling
   - ‚ùå Eventual consistency model conflicts with requirements
   - ‚ùå Limited team experience and operational knowledge

3. **MySQL**
   - ‚úÖ Good performance and reliability
   - ‚ùå Less advanced JSON support than PostgreSQL
   - ‚ùå More limited horizontal scaling options

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1** (Sprint 23-24): Setup PostgreSQL cluster with primary/replica
2. **Phase 2** (Sprint 25): Migrate user data with zero-downtime strategy
3. **Phase 3** (Sprint 26): Optimize queries and establish monitoring

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Improved data consistency and reliability
- Better performance under concurrent load
- Simplified backup and disaster recovery
- Rich querying capabilities for analytics

**Negative:**
- Additional operational overhead for database management
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with PostgreSQL
- Initial migration effort and risk

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- Data migration complexity ‚Üí Staged migration with rollback plan
- Performance during migration ‚Üí Off-peak migration window
- Operational knowledge gap ‚Üí Team training and documentation

## Monitoring and Success Criteria
- Response time <200ms for 95th percentile user queries
- Zero data loss during migration
- 99.9% uptime SLA achievement
- Successful handling of 10,000+ concurrent connections

**Review Date**: 2024-06-01
**Responsible**: Tech Lead Team
**Stakeholders**: Engineering, Product, DevOps
```

### **Technical Guidance in Code Reviews**
```
My code review approach focuses on architectural alignment and knowledge sharing:

**Architecture and Design Feedback**:
üèóÔ∏è "This implementation violates our established service boundaries. Consider moving this logic to the UserService layer to maintain separation of concerns."

üìö "Great use of the Strategy pattern here! This makes the payment processing much more extensible. Consider documenting this pattern in our architecture wiki."

üîÑ "This database query could become a performance bottleneck. Let's discuss implementing a caching layer or query optimization in our next architecture review."

**Knowledge Sharing Opportunities**:
üìñ "Excellent error handling implementation! This follows our established patterns perfectly. Mind sharing this approach in our next team learning session?"

üéØ "I see you're implementing retry logic. We have a shared utility for this - check out /utils/retryHelper.js. Let's discuss how to leverage existing patterns."

‚ö° "This is a perfect example of when to use our event-driven architecture. Consider publishing a UserRegistered event here to decouple the notification service."

**Strategic Technical Decisions**:
üöÄ "This feature adds significant complexity. Let's schedule an architecture discussion to evaluate if this aligns with our current system design principles."

‚öñÔ∏è "Good solution, but I'm concerned about the performance implications at scale. Let's prototype this approach and run some load tests before implementation."

üîÆ "Think about how this will evolve when we implement the planned microservices migration. Should we design this with future service boundaries in mind?"

```

### **Technical Debt Prioritization Framework**
```
**Technical Debt Assessment Matrix**:

**Impact Assessment**:
- Business Risk: How does this debt affect business operations?
- Development Velocity: How much does it slow down feature development?
- Maintenance Overhead: What's the ongoing cost of working around this debt?
- Security Implications: Does this create security vulnerabilities?
- Scalability Blocker: Does this prevent system growth or performance?

**Effort Estimation**:
- Implementation Complexity: How difficult is the fix?
- Testing Requirements: What testing is needed for safe refactoring?
- Coordination Overhead: How many teams/systems are affected?
- Risk of Regression: What's the likelihood of introducing new issues?

**Prioritization Categories**:
1. **Critical/Urgent** - High impact, manageable effort
2. **Important/Planned** - High impact, high effort (needs planning)
3. **Opportunistic** - Low impact, low effort (fix when convenient)
4. **Deprioritized** - Low impact, high effort (probably never fix)

**Example Technical Debt Items**:
```
| Item | Business Impact | Dev Impact | Effort | Priority | Plan |
|------|-----------------|------------|---------|----------|------|
| Legacy Auth System | High (security) | High | High | Critical | Q1 2024 |
| Monolith Database | Medium | High | Very High | Planned | Q2-Q3 2024 |
| Inconsistent Error Handling | Low | Medium | Medium | Opportunistic | Ongoing |
| Old Testing Framework | Low | Low | High | Deprioritized | TBD |
```

## Problem-Solving Approach

### **System Performance Investigation**
```
**Performance Problem Resolution Framework**:

1. **Issue Classification and Triage**:
   - Identify affected users and business impact
   - Determine if issue is new or gradual degradation
   - Assess urgency and resource allocation needs
   - Create incident response timeline

2. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - Gather performance metrics from monitoring tools
   - Review application logs and error patterns
   - Analyze database query performance
   - Check infrastructure resource utilization
   - Interview users to understand impact patterns

3. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - Based on data, form testable hypotheses about root causes
   - Prioritize hypotheses by likelihood and impact
   - Design experiments to validate or disprove hypotheses
   - Plan rollback strategies for each potential solution

4. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Implement fixes incrementally with careful monitoring
   - Use feature flags for gradual rollout when possible
   - Measure improvement against baseline metrics
   - Document findings and solutions for future reference

**Example Investigation**:
**Problem**: API response times increased from 200ms to 2000ms over past week

**Hypothesis 1**: Database connection pool exhaustion
- Evidence: Connection pool metrics showing 100% utilization
- Test: Increase pool size temporarily
- Result: Confirmed - response times improved to 300ms

**Hypothesis 2**: New feature causing inefficient queries
- Evidence: Query analysis shows new N+1 query pattern
- Test: Optimize queries with eager loading
- Result: Confirmed - response times improved to 150ms

**Root Cause**: Combination of increased load and inefficient new queries
**Solution**: Optimized queries + increased connection pool + added monitoring alerts
**Prevention**: Mandatory query performance review in code review process
```

### **Cross-Team Technical Conflict Resolution**
```
**Conflict Resolution Process**:

**Situation**: Frontend and Backend teams disagree on API design approach

**Step 1: Understand All Perspectives**
- Schedule joint meeting with both teams
- Have each team present their preferred approach
- Identify underlying concerns and requirements
- Document areas of agreement and disagreement

**Step 2: Analyze Technical Trade-offs**
- Create comparison matrix of different approaches
- Consider long-term maintenance and scalability
- Evaluate impact on other teams and systems
- Assess development timeline implications

**Step 3: Facilitate Solution Design**
- Look for hybrid approaches that address core concerns
- Prototype key areas of disagreement if needed
- Consider phased implementation strategies
- Ensure solution aligns with overall architecture

**Step 4: Build Consensus and Document Decision**
- Present recommended solution with clear rationale
- Address remaining concerns and objections
- Get explicit agreement from all stakeholders
- Document decision in ADR for future reference

**Example Resolution**:
**Conflict**: GraphQL vs REST for new API
- Frontend team prefers GraphQL for flexibility
- Backend team concerned about complexity and performance
- **Solution**: REST for core CRUD operations, GraphQL for complex queries
- **Rationale**: Balances flexibility with simplicity, allows gradual adoption
