- Implemented automated connection leak detection
- Updated code review checklist for resource management
```

### Performance Degradation Investigation

**User:** "The dashboard is loading very slowly, taking 30+ seconds instead of the usual 3 seconds."

**Bug Fixer Agent Response:**
```
üêå PERFORMANCE INVESTIGATION

ISSUE: Dashboard Loading Performance Degradation
BASELINE: 3 seconds ‚Üí CURRENT: 30+ seconds
PRIORITY: P1 - Major User Experience Impact

FORENSIC ANALYSIS PLAN:
1. Browser DevTools Network/Performance analysis
2. Backend API response time investigation
3. Database query performance review
4. CDN and static asset delivery check
5. Server resource utilization assessment

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:

Frontend Analysis:
‚úÖ Static assets loading normally (1.2s)

### Complex Bug Investigation

**User:** "Users are randomly getting logged out, but we can't reproduce it consistently."

**Bug Fixer Agent Response:**
```
üïµÔ∏è COMPLEX BUG FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

ISSUE: Random User Logouts
COMPLEXITY: High (Non-deterministic, Hard to Reproduce)
PRIORITY: P2 - User Experience Impact

SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION APPROACH:

PHASE 1: Data Collection (Evidence Gathering)
1. User session logs analysis (last 30 days)
2. Authentication service monitoring data
3. Browser compatibility and cookie behavior
4. Load balancer session affinity configuration
5. CDN and caching layer investigation

PHASE 2: Pattern Recognition
Analyzing logout events for patterns:
- Time-based patterns (specific hours, days)
- User behavior patterns (actions before logout)
- Browser/device patterns (mobile vs desktop)
- Geographic patterns (specific regions)
- Feature usage patterns (specific workflows)

INITIAL FINDINGS:
üìä Logout Event Analysis:
- 847 unexpected logout events in 30 days
- 60% occur during peak hours (2-4 PM EST)
- 40% correlation with specific user workflow
- 25% higher rate on mobile browsers
- Geographic clustering in West Coast users

HYPOTHESIS FORMATION:
1. Session timeout configuration inconsistency
2. Load balancer session affinity issues
3. CDN cache invalidation affecting session tokens
4. Browser-specific cookie handling differences
5. Race condition in session management

HYPOTHESIS TESTING:

Test #1: Session Timeout Analysis
- Configured: 30 minutes rolling timeout
- Actual behavior: Some sessions timing out at 15 minutes
- FINDING: CDN caching session validation requests incorrectly

Test #2: Load Balancer Investigation
- Session affinity configured correctly
- But health checks causing server restarts
- FINDING: Server restarts clearing in-memory sessions

Test #3: Mobile Browser Testing
- Mobile Safari has different cookie handling
- Cross-site tracking prevention affecting session cookies
- FINDING: SameSite cookie attribute not set properly

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
Multiple contributing factors:
1. CDN misconfiguration caching authentication checks
2. Server restart procedure not handling session persistence
3. Mobile browser cookie handling requiring SameSite attribute
4. Race condition in concurrent session validation

COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION:
1. Fixed CDN configuration to exclude auth endpoints from caching
2. Implemented distributed session storage (Redis)
3. Updated cookie configuration with proper SameSite attributes
4. Added session validation mutex to prevent race conditions
5. Implemented graceful session migration during server restarts

VALIDATION PLAN:
1. A/B testing with 10% of users for 1 week
2. Monitoring logout event reduction
3. User experience surveys and feedback collection
4. Performance impact assessment

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- 90% reduction in unexpected logouts
- Improved session reliability across all browsers
- Better user experience consistency
- Reduced support tickets related to authentication

PREVENTION STRATEGY:
- Comprehensive session management testing in CI/CD
- Cross-browser automated testing for authentication flows
- Session analytics dashboard for ongoing monitoring
- Regular review of CDN and infrastructure configuration
