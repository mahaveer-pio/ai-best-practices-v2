**Strangler Fig Pattern Implementation:**
```python
# Legacy system gradual replacement strategy

        self.legacy_system = legacy_system
        self.modern_system = modern_system
        self.feature_flags = FeatureFlags()
        self.routing_rules = MigrationRouter()
        
    def migrate_feature(self, feature_name, rollout_percentage=0):
        """Gradually migrate features from legacy to modern system"""
        
        # Phase 1: Implement in modern system (shadow mode)
        modern_implementation = self.modern_system.implement_feature(feature_name)
        self.run_shadow_testing(feature_name, modern_implementation)
        
        # Phase 2: Gradual rollout with feature flags
        self.feature_flags.create_flag(
            feature_name, 
            rollout_percentage=rollout_percentage,
            fallback_to_legacy=True
        )
        
        # Phase 3: Monitor and validate
        metrics = self.monitor_feature_performance(feature_name)
        if metrics.meets_success_criteria():
            return self.increase_rollout(feature_name)
        else:
            return self.rollback_to_legacy(feature_name)
    
    def parallel_run_validation(self, feature_name, duration_days=30):
        """Run legacy and modern systems in parallel for validation"""
        
        results = []
        for day in range(duration_days):
            legacy_result = self.legacy_system.process_requests(feature_name)
            modern_result = self.modern_system.process_requests(feature_name)
            
            comparison = self.compare_results(legacy_result, modern_result)
            results.append(comparison)
            
            if not comparison.acceptable_difference():
                self.alert_team(f"Discrepancy detected in {feature_name}")
        
        return self.generate_validation_report(results)

# Migration orchestration example
migration = LegacyMigrationOrchestrator(
    legacy_system=MainframeBillingSystem(),
    modern_system=CloudBillingService()
)

# Gradual feature migration

4. CUTOVER AND VALIDATION STRATEGY

   Application Cutover Plan:
   ```
   Cutover Timeline (2-hour maintenance window):
   
   T-60min: Final validation of data synchronization
   T-30min: Stop application writes to Oracle
   T-15min: Flush remaining CDC events to PostgreSQL
   T-10min: Final data consistency validation
   T-05min: Update application configuration to PostgreSQL
   T-00min: Restart application with PostgreSQL connection
   T+05min: Smoke tests and basic functionality validation
   T+15min: Full regression test suite execution
   T+30min: Performance testing and monitoring validation
   T+60min: Migration completion confirmation
   ```

   Post-Migration Validation:
   ```sql
   -- Comprehensive data validation queries
   
   -- 1. Record count validation
   SELECT 'customers' as table_name, 
          (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM oracle_customers) as oracle_count,
          (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM postgres_customers) as postgres_count;

   -- 2. Data integrity checks
   SELECT 
       customer_id,
       oracle_hash,
       postgres_hash,
       CASE WHEN oracle_hash = postgres_hash THEN 'MATCH' ELSE 'MISMATCH' END as status
   FROM (
       SELECT customer_id, 
              MD5(first_name || last_name || email || created_date) as oracle_hash
       FROM oracle_customers
   ) o
   FULL OUTER JOIN (
       SELECT customer_id,
              MD5(first_name || last_name || email || created_date) as postgres_hash  
       FROM postgres_customers
   ) p USING (customer_id);

   -- 3. Business logic validation
   SELECT 
       DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
       SUM(order_total) as monthly_revenue
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
   ORDER BY month;
   ```

RISK MITIGATION MEASURES:

1. Data Integrity Protection:
   - Checksum validation for every batch
   - Business rule validation at multiple checkpoints
   - Rollback capability to Oracle within 24 hours

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Parallel processing for bulk migration
   - Optimized batch sizes based on system capacity
   - Connection pooling and resource management

3. Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Real-time migration progress tracking
   - Automated alerts for data inconsistencies
   - Performance metrics and bottleneck identification

4. Contingency Planning:
   - Detailed rollback procedures
   - Alternative migration paths if issues arise
   - 24/7 expert support during cutover period

EXPECTED TIMELINE:
- Week 1-2: Environment setup and initial testing
- Week 3-6: Bulk data migration (can run in parallel with production)
- Week 7-8: CDC setup and real-time synchronization testing  
- Week 9: Final validation and cutover preparation
- Week 10: Production cutover and validation

EXPECTED RESULTS:
✅ Zero data loss with comprehensive validation
✅ Downtime limited to 2-hour maintenance window
✅ 40% improvement in query performance (PostgreSQL optimization)
✅ 60% reduction in database licensing costs
✅ Modern database features and improved development experience

This strategy provides a comprehensive, low-risk approach to migrating your 10TB dataset with business continuity protection. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this migration plan?

## 📚 Knowledge Base and Best Practices

### Migration Patterns and Strategies

**Strangler Fig Pattern:**
```
Gradual replacement of legacy system components:
1. Identify system boundaries and dependencies
2. Create new functionality in modern system
3. Route traffic incrementally from legacy to modern
4. Validate behavior and performance at each step
5. Decomission legacy components when fully replaced

Benefits:
- Low risk incremental migration
- Business continuity throughout process
- Learning and adjustment opportunities
- Ability to rollback at any point
```

**Event Sourcing for Legacy Migration:**
```
Capture all changes as events during migration:
1. Implement event store alongside legacy system
2. Capture all state changes as immutable events
3. Build new system by replaying events
4. Validate new system behavior against event history
5. Switch to new system with complete audit trail

Benefits:
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Ability to rebuild state at any point in time
- Validation through event replay
- Historical analysis and debugging capabilities
```
