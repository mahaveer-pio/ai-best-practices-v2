## 🎯 **Sample Workflow**

See how AI-assisted development works in practice:

### 1. **Write Code with AI Assistance**
```typescript
// [AI-Generated-Copilot] - Email validation utility
export function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
  return emailRegex.test(email)
}
```

### 2. **Commit with Automatic Detection**
```bash
git add src/utils/validation.ts
git commit -m "feat(utils): add email validation"
# → Git hook auto-detects AI content and transforms message
```

### 3. **Result: Properly Tagged Commit**
```
[AI-ASSISTED] feat(utils): add email validation

Generated by: GitHub Copilot
Reviewed by: John Doe
Scope: Utility Functions

Original message: feat(utils): add email validation
AI-generated code found in: src/utils/validation.ts
```

### 4. **Audit Trail Created**
- Commit logged in `.ai-commit-log`
- Traceability maintained for compliance
- Team visibility into AI usage
