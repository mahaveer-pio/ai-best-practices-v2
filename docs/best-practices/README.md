## ü§ñ GitHub Copilot Best Practices

### **Official GitHub Documentation:**
- **[Best Practices for Using GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/best-practices)** - Official GitHub guidance
- **[How to Write Better Prompts for GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/)** - Prompting strategies
- **[Using GitHub Copilot in Your IDE: Tips and Tricks](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-use-github-copilot-in-your-ide-tips-tricks-and-best-practices/)** - IDE integration guide

### **Context Management for Better Suggestions:**

**‚úÖ Do:**
- Keep relevant files open in your IDE for better context
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write clear comments before asking for code generation
- Close irrelevant files to avoid context pollution

**‚ùå Don't:**
- Work with too many unrelated files open
- Use vague or ambiguous prompts
- Ignore the surrounding code context
- Accept suggestions without understanding them

### **Effective Prompting Strategies:**

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Specific and contextual
// Create a React functional component that displays user profile information
// Include name, email, avatar, and a loading state
// Use TypeScript interfaces for props
function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {
  // Copilot will generate relevant code here
}

// ‚ùå Poor: Vague and unclear
// make component
function Component() {
  // Copilot has no context to work with
}
```

### **Security and Quality Guidelines:**

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Review all AI-generated code line by line
- [ ] Validate input sanitization and security measures
- [ ] Check for potential performance issues
- [ ] Ensure code follows team conventions and standards
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Verify proper error handling and logging

## üß† Claude AI Best Practices

### **Official Anthropic Documentation:**
- **[Prompt Engineering Overview](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview)** - Comprehensive prompting guide
- **[Claude 4 Best Practices](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices)** - Latest model optimization
- **[Use Examples (Multishot Prompting)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting)** - Advanced techniques

### **Advanced Prompting Techniques:**

**1. Be Clear and Explicit:**
```
‚úÖ Good:
"Act as a senior React developer. Create a reusable button component with TypeScript. 
Include variants for primary, secondary, and danger states. Add proper accessibility 
attributes and hover states. Follow the existing design system patterns."

‚ùå Poor:
"Make a button component"
```

**2. Use Examples (Few-Shot Learning):**
```
‚úÖ Good:
"Generate API error handling following this pattern:

Example 1:
try {
  const response = await api.getUser(id);
  return response.data;
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 404) {
    throw new UserNotFoundError(id);
  }
  throw new APIError(error.message);
}

Now create similar error handling for the createProject function."

‚ùå Poor:
"Add error handling to this function"
```

**3. Leverage Thinking Capabilities:**
```
"Think through the architecture implications of this microservice design.
Consider scalability, data consistency, and fault tolerance.
Then provide your recommendations with reasoning."
```

}

class AuthenticationService implements AuthService {
  // Implementation details...
}
```
