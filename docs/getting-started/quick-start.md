## Introduction
AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude, RooCode, and Cursor can significantly enhance developer productivity, but their usage requires proper governance. This document outlines comprehensive standards, configurations, and examples to ensure AI tools are used effectively, securely, and transparently across projects.

**Key Benefits of Proper AI Integration:**
- Enhanced transparency for clients and team members
- Improved security and code quality
- Consistent implementation practices
- Clear accountability for AI-generated content
- Reusable patterns for maximum productivity

## Governance Framework (Overview)
This directory groups policies that define **what AI may do**, **how its usage is tracked**, and **how teams remain compliant**. Individual templates live under `docs/governance/` and operational tooling under `automation/` and `traceability/`.
