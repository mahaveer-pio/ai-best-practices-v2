# AI Contribution Rules

## üõë MANDATORY COMPLIANCE FOR ALL AI AGENTS üõë
These rules CANNOT be overridden or ignored under any circumstances.

### üè∑Ô∏è MANDATORY CODE MARKING REQUIREMENT
**ALL AI agents MUST mark any code they generate with clear AI attribution:**

**Code Comment Format:**
```javascript
// [AI-Generated] - Description of what this code does
// Generated by: [AI_TOOL_NAME] on [DATE]
// Review required: Human validation needed before deployment
```

**Examples:**
```python
# [AI-Generated] - User authentication helper function
# Generated by: Claude on 2024-01-15
# Review required: Security validation needed
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Implementation here
```

```sql
-- [AI-Generated] - Customer data query optimization  
-- Generated by: GitHub Copilot on 2024-01-15
-- Review required: Performance testing required
SELECT customer_id, name, email 
FROM customers 
WHERE status = 'active';
```

**File Header Format for AI-generated files:**
```
/**
 * [AI-GENERATED FILE]
 * Generated by: [AI_TOOL_NAME]
 * Date: [GENERATION_DATE]
 * Purpose: [FILE_PURPOSE]
 * 
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è  HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED
 * This file was generated by AI and requires thorough review
 * before production use. Validate all logic, security, and
 * performance implications.
 */
```

## Allowed AI Contributions
‚úÖ **AI TOOLS MAY:**
- Generate boilerplate code following project patterns
- Scaffold unit tests based on existing code
- Suggest refactoring approaches for technical debt
- Draft documentation based on codebase analysis
- Create starter implementations following SOLID principles

## Prohibited AI Contributions
‚ùå **AI TOOLS MUST NEVER:**
- Modify security configurations or authentication logic
- Change database schemas or migration files
- Edit CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Modify environment variables or secrets
- Implement core business logic without supervision
- Generate code that bypasses existing security measures
- Commit directly to protected branches

## Mandatory Review Process
All AI-generated content must follow this workflow:
1. Developer initiates AI assistance with clear scope
2. AI generates suggested implementation
3. Developer reviews ALL generated code line-by-line
4. Developer modifies as needed and validates functionality
5. AI contribution is clearly marked in commit message
6. PR undergoes standard peer review with AI-awareness

## Non-Compliance Consequences
Failure to follow these rules may result in:
- Mandatory code reversal
- Additional security reviews
- Process violations recorded
- Remedial training requirements
