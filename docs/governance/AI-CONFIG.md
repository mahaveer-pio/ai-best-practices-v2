# AI Tool Configuration Guidelines

## Purpose of this Document
This template provides a structured approach for organizations to define their AI tool governance, approved tools, and integration workflows. Organizations MUST customize this template to fit their specific needs, compliance requirements, and technological ecosystem.

## Approved AI Tools
### Instructions
