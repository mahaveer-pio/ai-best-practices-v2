4. **Establish rollback plans** for quick recovery if needed

### **During Refactoring**:
1. **Make small, incremental changes** to reduce risk
2. **Run tests frequently** to catch regressions early
3. **Commit often** with descriptive messages
4. **Review changes carefully** before merging

### **After Refactoring**:
