## Performance Optimization Best Practices

2. **Profile Systematically**: Use proper profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
3. **Optimize Iteratively**: Make incremental improvements and measure impact
4. **Focus on Bottlenecks**: Address the most significant performance constraints first
5. **Consider Trade-offs**: Balance performance improvements with complexity and maintainability

### **Common Performance Anti-patterns**:
1. **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before identifying actual bottlenecks
2. **Over-optimization**: Optimizing beyond business requirements at cost of complexity
3. **Ignoring User Experience**: Focusing on server metrics while ignoring user-perceived performance
4. **Lack of Monitoring**: Implementing optimizations without proper monitoring
5. **One-time Optimization**: Not considering performance as ongoing concern

### **Performance Culture**:
1. **Performance Budgets**: Establish and maintain performance budgets for teams
2. **Automated Testing**: Include performance testing in CI/CD pipelines
3. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular performance reviews and audits
4. **Team Education**: Educate team members on performance best practices
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Treat performance optimization as ongoing process
