## 🎯 Advanced Prompting Principles

### 1. **Context-Rich Prompting**
Always provide comprehensive context including:
- Project constraints and requirements
- Technology stack and architectural patterns
- Team standards and coding conventions
- Business objectives and user needs

### 2. **Multi-Perspective Analysis**
Use prompts that encourage AI to:
- Consider multiple solution approaches
- Analyze trade-offs and implications
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Evaluate scalability and maintainability

### 3. **Iterative Refinement**
Structure prompts for continuous improvement:
- Request initial analysis with reasoning
- Ask for alternative approaches
- Validate assumptions and edge cases
- Refine based on feedback and constraints

### 4. **Output Specification**
Define clear output formats:
- Structured responses with headers and sections
- Code examples with explanations
- Decision matrices and comparison tables
- Action items and next steps

## 🛠️ Claude-Specific Techniques

### Think Harder Prompts
```
Think harder about this problem. Take a step back and:
1. Analyze the root cause deeply
2. Consider non-obvious solutions
3. Evaluate long-term implications
4. Challenge your initial assumptions
```

### Ultrathinking Approach
```
Use ultrathinking to approach this challenge:
- Break down the problem into micro-components
- Examine each component from multiple angles
- Synthesize insights into a comprehensive solution
- Validate the solution against edge cases
```

### Forensic Analysis Pattern
```
Perform a forensic analysis of [problem/code/requirement]:
1. Trace the complete timeline/flow
2. Identify all contributing factors
3. Map relationships and dependencies
4. Recommend preventive measures
```

## 📚 Usage Examples

### For Developers
```
Act as a senior software architect. I need to implement [feature] in [technology stack]. 
Think harder about the architectural implications and provide:
1. Multiple implementation approaches with trade-offs
2. Scalability considerations
3. Security implications
4. Testing strategies
5. Maintenance requirements

Context: [Your project context here]
```

### For QA Engineers
```
As a QA expert, perform ultrathinking on testing strategy for [feature]. Consider:
1. Functional testing scenarios (happy path + edge cases)
2. Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
3. Integration points and potential failure modes
4. Automation opportunities and frameworks
5. Risk-based testing prioritization
