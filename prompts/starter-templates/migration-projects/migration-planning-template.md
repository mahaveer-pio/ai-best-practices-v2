## üìù Template Usage Example

### **Legacy .NET Framework to .NET Core Migration**

**Project Context**: Migrate enterprise application from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 6

**Phase 1 - Discovery Results**:
- **Current State**: 500K LOC, SQL Server, Windows services, 15 external integrations
- **Pain Points**: Performance issues, security vulnerabilities, scaling limitations
- **Migration Complexity**: High due to dependencies and custom frameworks

**Migration Strategy**: Strangler Fig pattern with 6-month timeline
- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure and data layer migration (2 months)
- **Phase 2**: Core business services migration (3 months)  
- **Phase 3**: UI and integration layer migration (1 month)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 50% performance improvement
- Enhanced security and compliance
- Cloud-native scalability and deployment
- Reduced maintenance and operational costs
