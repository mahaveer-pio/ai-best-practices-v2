High Value, Low Complexity: Quick Wins (Immediate Priority)
High Value, High Complexity: Major Projects (Next Quarter Planning)
Low Value, Low Complexity: Fill-ins (Resource Availability)
Low Value, High Complexity: Time Sinks (Avoid/Deprioritize)

Complexity Factors:
- Technical implementation difficulty
- Cross-team coordination requirements
- External dependency complexity
- User adoption and training requirements

- Leading indicator monitoring and course correction
- Stakeholder alignment and expectation management

Progress Scoring:
0.0-0.3: Red (High risk of failure)
0.4-0.6: Yellow (On track but requires attention)  
0.7-1.0: Green (On track to exceed expectations)
>1.0: Exceptional performance (stretch goal achievement)

OKR Health Metrics:
- Alignment Score: How well OKRs connect to company strategy
- Stretch Factor: Appropriate difficulty level (aim for 70% achievement)
- Engagement Level: Team motivation and buy-in
- Resource Utilization: Efficiency of effort allocation

Monthly OKR Review Process:
Week 1: Progress assessment and metric updates
Week 2: Roadblock identification and problem-solving

- Contributing Key Results (one team's KR supports another's Objective)
- Dependency mapping (critical path identification)
- Regular cross-team sync meetings

Conflict Resolution Process:
1. Identify conflicting priorities or resource constraints
2. Escalate to shared manager or leadership team
3. Reassess strategic importance and trade-offs
4. Adjust OKRs to resolve conflicts and maintain alignment
5. Communicate changes and rationale to all stakeholders

Success Dependencies:
- Engineering team delivery commitments
- Marketing team campaign performance
- Sales team pipeline development
- Customer success team retention efforts

- How do behavioral incentives align with stated objectives?
- What unintended consequences might these OKRs create?
- How will we know if we're achieving objectives for the right reasons?
- What would success look like from different stakeholder perspectives?

**OKR Planning Deliverables:**
1. **Quarterly OKR Framework** (objectives and key results with rationale)
2. **Measurement Dashboard** (tracking system and progress indicators)
3. **Alignment Map** (cross-team dependencies and shared goals)
